This is an interactive flashcard game to learn and practice the present indicative conjugations of common Romanian verbs. 

I created the game fully via vibe-coding using Gemini Canvas with the Gemini 2.5 Pro model. It's publicly available on [this github page](https://erkutdemirhan.github.io/RomanianFlashCards/)
